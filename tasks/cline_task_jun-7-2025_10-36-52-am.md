**Assistant:**

Okay, I understand the issue. The `microfrontendLoader` needs to be invoked in a client-side context to function correctly with the layout registration.

To devise a plan, I'll start by examining the relevant files.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I've reviewed `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.
The line `import '@/lib/microfrontendLoader';` is indeed present. In Next.js 13+ (App Router), `layout.tsx` files are Server Components by default. This means the `microfrontendLoader` is likely being executed during server-side rendering or at build time, not in the client's browser environment where it's needed to dynamically load and register microfrontends.

To address this, we'll need to ensure the `microfrontendLoader` logic runs on the client side.

Next, I'll examine the `microfrontendLoader.ts` file to understand its current implementation.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I've reviewed `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`. This file correctly uses `React.lazy` for the microfrontend component and calls `registerMicrofrontend`. The critical part is ensuring this registration logic executes in the browser.

The comment `// To ensure this module executes and registers the MFE, // it needs to be imported in a central part of the application, // e.g., in RootLayout (layout.tsx) or the main page.tsx.` is key. While importing it in `RootLayout` was the intention, the server-side nature of `layout.tsx` prevents it from running on the client as desired.

To fix this, we need to move the import of `microfrontendLoader` into a component that is guaranteed to run on the client side. A common pattern in Next.js is to create a specific client component for such initializations or to use an existing client component that's part of the main layout.

Let's examine `apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx`. If it's a client component (or can be converted to one), it would be a suitable place to import the `microfrontendLoader`.

**Assistant:**

Excellent. The `Navigation.tsx` component starts with `'use client';`, which means it's a Client Component. This is exactly what we need. Since the `Navigation` component is already part of the `RootLayout`, importing the `microfrontendLoader` here will ensure it executes in the client's browser.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Modify `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`**:
    *   Remove the line: `import '@/lib/microfrontendLoader'; // Initialize and register microfrontends`
    *   This will prevent the loader from being executed on the server side.

2.  **Modify `apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx`**:
    *   Add the line: `import '@/lib/microfrontendLoader';` near the other imports.
    *   This will ensure the `microfrontendLoader.ts` module is executed when the `Navigation` component mounts on the client side, correctly registering the microfrontends.

This approach leverages Next.js's distinction between Server and Client Components to ensure the microfrontend registration logic runs in the appropriate environment.

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>
Okay, I've analyzed the files. The issue is that `microfrontendLoader.ts` is being imported in `layout.tsx`, which is a Server Component by default in Next.js. This means the loader logic runs on the server, not in the client's browser where it's needed for dynamic loading and registration.

The `Navigation.tsx` component is already a Client Component (due to `'use client';` at the top) and is used in the `RootLayout`. This makes it an ideal place to ensure our `microfrontendLoader` runs on the client.

Here's the proposed solution:

1.  **In `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`:**
    *   We will **remove** the line:
        ```typescript
        import '@/lib/microfrontendLoader'; // Initialize and register microfrontends
        ```

2.  **In `apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx`:**
    *   We will **add** the following import statement at the top of the file, likely after the existing imports:
        ```typescript
        import '@/lib/microfrontendLoader';
        ```

This change will shift the execution of the `microfrontendLoader` to the client-side, allowing it to register the microfrontends correctly within the browser environment.

Does this plan sound good to you? If so, please ask me to "toggle to Act mode" so I can implement these changes.

**Assistant:**

The import has been successfully added to `apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx`.

The `microfrontendLoader` will now be initialized in the `Navigation` component, which is a client component, ensuring that the microfrontends are registered in the browser environment.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
The microfrontend loader initialization has been moved from the server-side `layout.tsx` to the client-side `Navigation.tsx` component. This ensures that the `microfrontendLoader.ts` script executes in the browser, allowing microfrontends to be correctly registered and loaded.
