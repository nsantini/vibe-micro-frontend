# Microfrontend: Markdown Notes

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature introduces a new microfrontend for creating, editing, and managing markdown notes. The goal is to provide users with a simple, intuitive interface to write and organize notes using markdown syntax, enhancing productivity and knowledge management within the application.

## 2. Goals

- Allow users to create, edit, and delete markdown-formatted notes.
- Provide a live preview of markdown rendering as users type.
- Enable users to organize notes (e.g., by title or date).
- Ensure notes are persisted and retrievable across sessions.

## 3. User Stories

- As a user, I want to create a new note using markdown so that I can format my thoughts efficiently.
- As a user, I want to edit existing notes so that I can update or correct information.
- As a user, I want to delete notes I no longer need so that my workspace stays organized.
- As a user, I want to see a live preview of my markdown note so that I know how it will look when saved.
- As a user, I want my notes to be saved and accessible when I return to the application.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow users to create new notes with a title and markdown content.
2. The system must provide an editor with markdown syntax support.
3. The system must display a live preview of the rendered markdown as the user types.
4. The system must allow users to edit and update existing notes.
5. The system must allow users to delete notes.
6. The system must persist notes so they are available across sessions (e.g., via backend storage or local storage).
7. The system must display a list of existing notes, sortable by title or date.
8. The system must handle and display errors gracefully (e.g., failed save, invalid markdown).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Real-time collaborative editing between multiple users.
- Advanced organization features (e.g., folders, tags, search).
- Rich media embedding (e.g., images, videos) beyond standard markdown capabilities.
- Offline editing or synchronization.
- User authentication or permissions management.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- The UI should be clean and minimal, focusing on the editor and preview.
- Use existing design system components where possible.
- The markdown preview should closely match the application's display styles.
- Consider using a popular markdown editor library for consistency and reliability.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- Should integrate with the existing microfrontend architecture.
- Notes persistence can be implemented via backend API or browser local storage, depending on existing infrastructure.
- Use a well-maintained markdown parsing/rendering library to avoid security issues (e.g., XSS).
- Ensure accessibility for keyboard and screen reader users.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Users can successfully create, edit, and delete notes without errors.
- At least 90% of users report satisfaction with the markdown editing experience (via feedback or survey).
- No critical bugs reported related to note persistence or markdown rendering after release.
- Feature adoption: At least 50% of active users create at least one note within the first month.

## 9. Open Questions

- Should notes be private to each user, or is there a need for sharing/public notes in the future?
- What is the maximum size for a single note?
- Should there be any version history or undo functionality?
- Is there a preferred markdown editor or library to use?
- Should the feature support mobile devices or be desktop-only initially?
