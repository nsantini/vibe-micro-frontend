# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Microfrontend Foundation

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for establishing the foundation of a microfrontend architecture using Next.js and Material UI. The goal is to enable scalable, modular development where each feature is implemented as an independent microfrontend, while providing a robust base for future expansion. The foundation should simplify the integration of new features and minimize complexity as the codebase grows.

## 2. Goals

- Provide a scaffolded codebase for a microfrontend architecture using Next.js and Material UI.
- Enable easy registration and integration of new microfrontends (features).
- Implement a routing system that supports navigation between microfrontends.
- Include a simple "home page" microfrontend as an example.
- Ensure the foundation is clear and accessible for developers, including those using AI Agents for feature development.

## 3. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to be able to easily create and integrate a new microfrontend into the application so that I can add features without increasing overall codebase complexity.
- As a developer, I want clear scaffolding and documentation so that I can quickly understand how to register and route new microfrontends.
- As a developer, I want a working example (home page microfrontend) to reference when building new features.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must provide a scaffolded Next.js project structure suitable for microfrontend development.
2. The system must use Material UI for the presentation layer and shared UI components.
3. The system must support dynamic registration and routing of microfrontends.
4. The system must include a navigation component that lists and links to all registered microfrontends.
5. The system must include a simple "home page" microfrontend as a working example.
6. The system must provide clear instructions or scripts for developers to add new microfrontends.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Cross-microfrontend state management is not required in the initial foundation.
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for all microfrontends is not required at this stage.
- No authentication or authorization mechanisms are included in the foundation.
- No deployment or CI/CD configuration is included in this initial setup.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- Use Material UI for all shared and example components.
- Navigation should be simple and extensible.
- The home page microfrontend should demonstrate best practices for integration.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- The architecture should allow for independent development and future deployment of microfrontends.
- The codebase should be organized to minimize coupling between microfrontends.
- Consider using a monorepo structure if it simplifies development and integration.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Developers can add and register a new microfrontend in less than 30 minutes following the provided instructions.
- The navigation correctly displays and routes to all registered microfrontends.
- The home page microfrontend works as a reference implementation.

## 9. Open Questions

- Will microfrontends be developed in a monorepo or polyrepo setup?
    - In a monorepo style. Will be part of this same repo
- Should there be a standard interface or contract for microfrontends?
    - Standard interface
- How will shared dependencies (e.g., Material UI) be managed across microfrontends in the future?
    - Propose the best approach
