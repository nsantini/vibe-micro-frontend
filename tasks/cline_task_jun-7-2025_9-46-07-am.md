## Relevant Files

- `apps/main-app/` - Main Next.js application serving as the host for microfrontends.
- `apps/main-app/pages/_app.tsx` - Custom App component for global providers and Material UI setup.
- `apps/main-app/components/Navigation.tsx` - Navigation component listing and linking all registered microfrontends.
- `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/` - Example "home page" microfrontend implementation.
- `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md` - Documentation for adding/registering new microfrontends.
- `apps/main-app/utils/microfrontendRegistry.ts` - Logic for dynamic registration and routing of microfrontends.
- `apps/main-app/components/Navigation.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the navigation component.
- `apps/main-app/utils/microfrontendRegistry.test.ts` - Unit tests for the microfrontend registry logic.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `Navigation.tsx` and `Navigation.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The user wants to run the command as the current user, not with `sudo`. The previous attempt without `sudo` failed due to a permissions issue ("The application path is not writable"). This implies that the current user (`nico`) does not have write permissions in the `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` directory, or more specifically, cannot create `apps/main-app` within it.

To resolve this, I need to ensure the current user has write permissions for the `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` directory. I can try to change the ownership of the directory to the current user.

Steps:
1.  Determine the current username. From the system information, the home directory is `/Users/nico`, so the username is likely `nico`.
2.  Change the ownership of the `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` directory to the current user (`nico`).
3.  Retry the `create-next-app` command without `sudo`.

Alternatively, I could ask the user to fix the permissions themselves, but it's better if I can propose a command to do it.
The command `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` should grant the current user ownership of the working directory.
Then I can re-run the `create-next-app` command.
</thinking>
Understood. It seems the initial problem was indeed a permissions issue with the current directory.

First, I'll try to fix the directory permissions by changing the ownership of the current working directory (`/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend`) to your user. This command uses `sudo` to change ownership, so it might ask for your password.

Command to change directory ownership:
This command will recursively change the owner of the `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` directory to the current logged-in user.

<thinking>
The `chown` command supposedly completed successfully, but the `create-next-app` command still fails with the same "application path is not writable" error. This is unexpected.

Possible reasons:
1.  The `chown` command didn't actually succeed or didn't have the intended effect, despite the user's confirmation.
2.  The `$(whoami)` part of the `chown` command might not have resolved to the correct user in the context where `execute_command` runs it, although this is less likely if the user confirmed it worked.
3.  There's a more specific permission issue within the `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` directory, or perhaps on one of its parent directories, that `chown -R $(whoami) .` didn't resolve.
4.  The `create-next-app` script itself has some specific requirements or checks that are failing in a way that misleadingly reports a permission issue.
5.  The user might have multiple user accounts, and `$(whoami)` in the terminal where they ran `chown` is different from the user context of the `create-next-app` script if it's run by an IDE extension or similar. However, the prompt "Password:" for `chown` suggests it was run by the user directly.

Since `chown -R $(whoami) /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` should have given the current user full control, this is puzzling.

Let's try to be more explicit with permissions using `chmod`.
I'll try `chmod -R u+w /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` to ensure the user (owner) has write permissions recursively. This shouldn't require `sudo` if the `chown` was successful.

If that doesn't work, I might have to ask the user to manually verify permissions or try creating a directory manually using `mkdir` to see if that works.

Let's try `chmod` first.
</thinking>
It's strange that the permission issue persists even after the `chown` command. Let's try explicitly granting write permissions to the user for the current working directory.

This command will recursively grant write permissions to the owner (user) of the `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` directory and its contents.

<command>chmod -R u+w /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend</command>

The `chmod` command completed. Hopefully, this has resolved the permission issue.

The permission issue is remarkably persistent. Both `chown` and `chmod` commands, which should have resolved this, did not.
The error "The application path is not writable" from `create-next-app` is quite specific.

At this point, standard permission fixes aren't working. There might be something more unusual at play:
1.  Filesystem ACLs (Access Control Lists) that are overriding standard Unix permissions.
2.  The directory `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` or one of its parents might be mounted in a special way (e.g., read-only, or a network share with specific restrictions).
3.  macOS specific protections like System Integrity Protection (SIP) or other security features, though usually these affect system directories, not user workspace directories.
4.  The `create-next-app` script might be trying to write to a location *other* than the specified `apps/main-app` initially (e.g., a global cache directory for which it lacks permissions), and then misreporting the error as being about the application path.
5.  The path `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` itself might have an issue, or the `apps` directory within it if it already exists.

Let's try a very basic operation: can we even create a directory and a file within `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` using standard commands? This will help isolate if the issue is with `create-next-app` or with basic write operations in that directory.

I will try to:
1. Create a test directory: `mkdir /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend/test_dir_ Cline`
2. Create a test file inside it: `touch /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend/test_dir_ Cline/test_file.txt`

If these commands fail, then the problem is fundamental to writing in that directory. If they succeed, the problem is more likely specific to `create-next-app` or its interaction with the environment.

Given the repeated failures, it's also worth asking the user if they have any insights into why this directory might be problematic (e.g., is it a synced folder like Dropbox/Google Drive, a mounted volume, or under some special management?).
</thinking>
This is very persistent. Despite the `chown` and `chmod` commands, `create-next-app` still reports that the path is not writable.

Let's try a more basic test to see if your user can write to this directory at all. I'll attempt to create a simple test directory and a file within it.

This command will first try to create a directory named `cline_permission_test` inside `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` and then create an empty file named `test.txt` inside `cline_permission_test`.

<execute_command>
<command>mkdir /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend/cline_permission_test &amp;&amp; touch /Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend/cline_permission_test/test.txt</command>
<requires_approval>false</requires_approval>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The `mkdir` and `touch` commands executed, and the user's response doesn't indicate an error. This implies that basic write operations *are* possible in `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` for the current user. This makes the `create-next-app` error even more puzzling.

If basic writes work, the issue might be specific to how `create-next-app` (or `npm`/`npx`) operates.
Possibilities:
1.  `create-next-app` is trying to create the `apps/main-app` directory, and for some reason, that specific operation is failing even if creating `cline_permission_test` worked.
2.  `npx` itself is having trouble writing to its cache or temporary directories, and this is manifesting as an error related to the target application path.
3.  There's an interaction with Node.js version or npm version.
4.  The `--src-dir` or `--app` flags, or the combination of flags, is causing an issue on this specific setup.

Let's try to break down the `create-next-app` step:
1.  Manually create the `apps/main-app` directory.
2.  Then, run `create-next-app` targeting the *existing* `apps/main-app` directory. Sometimes `create-next-app` behaves differently if the target directory already exists (it usually prompts to overwrite or use it).

First, I'll try to create the `apps/main-app` directory structure.
Then, I'll try running `create-next-app .` from within `apps/main-app`.

Let's also clean up the test directory I created.
</thinking>
Okay, the test directory and file were created successfully. This means your user *can* write to the `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend` directory. This makes the persistent error from `create-next-app` very strange.

Let's try a slightly different approach:
1.  I'll first remove the test directory I created.
2.  Then, I'll manually create the `apps/main-app` directory structure.
3.  Finally, I'll try running `create-next-app` from *within* the `apps/main-app` directory, telling it to use the current directory (`.`).

Step 1: Remove the test directory.
This command will remove the `cline_permission_test` directory and its contents.

Excellent! Manually creating the `apps/main-app` directory and then running `create-next-app .` from within it worked. This indicates the issue was likely with how `create-next-app` handles directory creation or path resolution in the initial attempts.

Now that sub-task 1.1 is complete, I need to:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 1.1 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (1.2).

To update the task list, I'll use `replace_in_file`.
The line to change is:
`- [ ] 1.1 Initialize a new Next.js app in \`apps/main-app/\``
to
`- [x] 1.1 Initialize a new Next.js app in \`apps/main-app/\``
</thinking>
Great! It seems that manually creating the directory first and then running the command from within it resolved the issue. The Next.js app has been successfully initialized in `apps/main-app/`.

Now, I will update the task list to mark sub-task 1.1 as complete.

The user has approved proceeding with task 1.2: "Set up a monorepo structure (e.g., using Yarn/NPM workspaces or Turborepo)".

The Next.js app was created in `apps/main-app/`. A monorepo structure typically involves having a root `package.json` and then individual packages (like `apps/main-app`) listed as workspaces.

I'll choose NPM workspaces as it's built into NPM and doesn't require an additional tool like Turborepo or Lerna initially, keeping it simpler. Yarn workspaces would be another option if Yarn was already in use, but the Next.js app was initialized using `npm`.

Steps to set up NPM workspaces:
1.  **Initialize a `package.json` in the root directory** (`/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend`). This will be the monorepo root.
    Command: `npm init -y` in the root directory.
2.  **Modify the root `package.json` to define workspaces.**
    Add a `"workspaces"` array. It should include the `apps/main-app` directory.
    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "minifrontend-monorepo", // Or similar
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "private": true, // Monorepo roots are typically private
      "workspaces": [
        "apps/*" // This will include apps/main-app
      ]
      // ... other fields from npm init -y
    }
    ```
3.  The `apps/main-app/package.json` already exists from `create-next-app`. Its `name` field will be used by NPM to identify the workspace package.

Let's start by initializing the root `package.json`. The current working directory is `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend`, which is the correct place for the monorepo root.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 1.2: Set up a monorepo structure. I will use NPM workspaces.

First, I'll initialize a `package.json` file in the root of your project (`/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend`). This file will define the monorepo.

This command will create a `package.json` file with default values.

<execute_command>
<command>npm init -y</command>
<requires_approval>true</requires_approval>
</execute_command>

The root `package.json` has been created. Now I need to modify it to:
1.  Set `"private": true`, which is standard practice for monorepo root packages that are not meant to be published themselves.
2.  Add the `"workspaces"` field to include `apps/*`, which will cover our `apps/main-app`.

I will use `replace_in_file` to make these changes. I need to be careful to construct the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks correctly.
The current content is:
```json
{
  "name": "minifrontend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

I want to change it to something like:
```json
{
  "name": "minifrontend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*"
  ],
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```
I'll insert `"private": true,` and `"workspaces": ["apps/*"],` after the `"version": "1.0.0",` line.
</thinking>
The root `package.json` has been created. Now I'll modify it to set it up for NPM workspaces. I'll add the `private: true` field and the `workspaces` configuration.

Task 1.2 is complete and the task list has been updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 1.3: "Configure TypeScript support".
However, when we initialized the Next.js app in task 1.1, we used the `--typescript` flag:
`npx create-next-app@latest apps/main-app --typescript --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --import-alias "@/*"`
This means TypeScript support should already be configured for the `apps/main-app` package.

A `tsconfig.json` file should exist in `apps/main-app/`. I should verify this.
If it exists and is correctly set up by `create-next-app`, then task 1.3 is effectively already completed.

I will ask the user for permission to proceed, and also mention that TypeScript was likely already configured.

When the Next.js app was initialized in `apps/main-app/` (task 1.1), we included the `--typescript` flag. This should have already set up TypeScript support within that package, including a `tsconfig.json` file.

The user has approved proceeding with verifying TypeScript configuration (1.3) and then moving to 1.4.

To verify TypeScript configuration for `apps/main-app`, I need to check for the existence of `apps/main-app/tsconfig.json`.
I can use the `read_file` tool for this. If the file exists, `read_file` will return its content. If it doesn't, it will result in an error that indicates the file was not found. This is sufficient to confirm its existence.
</thinking>
Okay, I'll first verify the TypeScript configuration for the `apps/main-app` package by checking for the `tsconfig.json` file.

The file `apps/main-app/tsconfig.json` exists and its content confirms it's configured for a Next.js TypeScript project. This means sub-task 1.3 "Configure TypeScript support" is indeed complete as a result of the `create-next-app` command with the `--typescript` flag.

Now I need to:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 1.3 as complete.
2.  Since the user already approved moving to 1.4, I will proceed with that task directly after updating the task list.

The line to change in the task list is:
`- [ ] 1.3 Configure TypeScript support`
to
`- [x] 1.3 Configure TypeScript support`
</thinking>
The `apps/main-app/tsconfig.json` file exists and is correctly configured. This confirms that TypeScript support (sub-task 1.3) was set up during the Next.js app initialization.

I will now update the task list to mark sub-task 1.3 as complete.

Task 1.3 is complete and the task list is updated.
The user has already approved moving to task 1.4: "Set up basic folder structure for microfrontends (e.g., `microfrontends/` directory)".

This task requires creating a directory named `microfrontends/` inside the `apps/main-app/` directory.
The Next.js app was created with a `src` directory (`apps/main-app/src/`). The microfrontends directory should probably live alongside or within `src`, or at the root of `apps/main-app`.
The task description in the PRD mentions:
- `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/` - Example "home page" microfrontend implementation.
- `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md` - Documentation for adding/registering new microfrontends.
This implies the `microfrontends` directory should be directly under `apps/main-app/`.

So, the path to create is `apps/main-app/microfrontends/`.
I will use `mkdir -p` to create this directory.
</thinking>
Task 1.3 is complete. Now proceeding with sub-task 1.4: "Set up basic folder structure for microfrontends (e.g., `microfrontends/` directory)".

I will create a directory named `microfrontends` inside `apps/main-app/`.

The `microfrontends` directory has been created under `apps/main-app/`.
This completes sub-task 1.4.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 1.4 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (1.5).

The user has approved proceeding with task 1.5: "Add initial README with project structure overview".

This README should be created at the project root: `/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend/README.md`.
It needs to provide an overview of the project structure.

The current structure is:
```
minifrontend/

## Overview

- **Monorepo Setup**: The project uses NPM workspaces to manage multiple packages. The root `package.json` defines the workspaces.
- **Host Application (`apps/main-app`)**: This is a Next.js application that will serve as the host or shell for the microfrontends. It includes:
    - TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS pre-configured.
    - A `src/` directory for its source code.
    - An `apps/main-app/microfrontends/` directory, which is intended to house the individual microfrontend packages/applications.

The `README.md` file has been created in the project root.
This completes sub-task 1.5.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 1.5 as complete.
2.  Since 1.5 is the last sub-task under parent task 1.0, I also need to mark parent task 1.0 as complete.
3.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next main task (2.0), specifically sub-task 2.1.

Lines to change in the task list:
`- [ ] 1.5 Add initial README with project structure overview`
to
`- [x] 1.5 Add initial README with project structure overview`

And:
`- [ ] 1.0 Scaffold Next.js project structure for microfrontends`
to
`- [x] 1.0 Scaffold Next.js project structure for microfrontends`
</thinking>
The initial `README.md` with the project structure overview has been created. This completes sub-task 1.5.

Since all sub-tasks under "1.0 Scaffold Next.js project structure for microfrontends" are now complete, I will mark both sub-task 1.5 and the parent task 1.0 as complete in the task list.

The user has approved proceeding with task 2.1: "Install Material UI and peer dependencies".

Material UI (MUI) installation typically involves installing several packages:
- `@mui/material` (core components)
- `@emotion/react` (styling engine, peer dependency)
- `@emotion/styled` (styling engine, peer dependency)
- Optionally, `@mui/icons-material` for icons.

These dependencies should be installed in the `apps/main-app` package, as this is where the UI will be primarily rendered and themed.
Since we are using NPM workspaces, I should run the install command from the root of the monorepo (`/Users/nico/Workspace/minifrontend`) and specify the workspace.
The command would be `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material -w apps/main-app`.
The `-w apps/main-app` flag (or `--workspace=apps/main-app`) tells npm to install these dependencies into the `apps/main-app` workspace.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 2.1: "Install Material UI and peer dependencies".

I will install Material UI, its peer dependencies (`@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`), and `@mui/icons-material` into the `apps/main-app` workspace. The command will be run from the monorepo root.

This command will add these packages as dependencies to `apps/main-app/package.json`.

Material UI and its dependencies have been successfully installed into the `apps/main-app` workspace.
This completes sub-task 2.1.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 2.1 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (2.2).

The line to change in the task list is:
`- [ ] 2.1 Install Material UI and peer dependencies`
to
`- [x] 2.1 Install Material UI and peer dependencies`
</thinking>
Material UI and its peer dependencies have been successfully installed in the `apps/main-app` package. This completes sub-task 2.1.

I will now update the task list.

Task 2.1 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 2.2: "Configure Material UI theme provider in `_app.tsx`".
The file path mentioned is `apps/main-app/pages/_app.tsx`. However, the Next.js app was initialized with the App Router (`--app` flag) and a `src` directory (`--src-dir` flag). In this setup, the global layout and providers are typically handled in `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`, not `pages/_app.tsx` (which is for the Pages Router).

I need to:
1.  Verify if `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` exists.
2.  If it exists, this is the file I should modify to add the MUI ThemeProvider and CssBaseline.
3.  If it doesn't exist, or if there's a `pages/_app.tsx`, I need to clarify which file to use. Given the setup flags, `layout.tsx` is the strong candidate.

I'll ask for permission to proceed and mention the likely file to modify (`layout.tsx` instead of `_app.tsx`).
</thinking>
Sub-task 2.1 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 2.2: "Configure Material UI theme provider in `_app.tsx`".
Given that the Next.js application in `apps/main-app/` was set up using the App Router (with a `src/app` directory), the global configuration, including theme providers, is typically handled in `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` rather than a `pages/_app.tsx` file.

May I proceed with configuring the Material UI theme provider in `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`?

The user confirmed to use `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` for configuring the Material UI theme provider.

To configure the MUI theme provider, I need to:
1.  Read the current content of `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.
2.  Modify it to include:
    *   A basic MUI theme (e.g., `createTheme` from `@mui/material/styles`).
    *   The `ThemeProvider` from `@mui/material/styles` wrapping the `children`.
    *   `CssBaseline` from `@mui/material` for baseline styling.
    *   Since this is a Next.js App Router setup, and MUI components might be client components, I'll likely need to make the `RootLayout` (or a part of it) a client component by adding `"use client";` at the top of the file or a new component file. For simplicity and to ensure MUI works correctly, making the `layout.tsx` (or a wrapper component within it) a client component is often necessary. The MUI documentation for Next.js App Router recommends creating a `ThemeRegistry` component that handles this. This is a best practice.

Let's follow the MUI documentation approach:
1.  Create a new file `apps/main-app/src/components/ThemeRegistry.tsx` (or similar, e.g., `ThemeRegistry/ThemeRegistry.tsx` or `theme/ThemeRegistry.tsx`). The task list mentions creating `components/` later (2.3), but for this specific setup, it's cleaner to encapsulate theme logic. I'll create it as `apps/main-app/src/theme/ThemeRegistry.tsx`.
2.  Implement the `ThemeRegistry` component as per MUI docs for Next.js App Router. This component will include `"use client";`, `ThemeProvider`, `CssBaseline`, and a basic theme.
3.  Modify `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` to import and use this `ThemeRegistry` to wrap its `children`.

First, I'll create the `ThemeRegistry.tsx` file.
The path will be `apps/main-app/src/theme/ThemeRegistry.tsx`.
</thinking>
Okay, I will proceed with configuring the Material UI theme provider in `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.

Following Material UI's recommended approach for the Next.js App Router, I'll first create a `ThemeRegistry` component. This component will encapsulate the `ThemeProvider` and `CssBaseline`.

I'll create this new component at `apps/main-app/src/theme/ThemeRegistry.tsx`.

The `EmotionCache.tsx` file has been created. Now that both `ThemeRegistry.tsx` and `EmotionCache.tsx` are in place, I can modify `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` to use the `ThemeRegistry`.

Steps:
1.  Read the current content of `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.
2.  Import `ThemeRegistry` from `../../theme/ThemeRegistry` (adjust path as needed, should be `../theme/ThemeRegistry` if `layout.tsx` is in `src/app/` and `ThemeRegistry` is in `src/theme/`).
3.  Wrap the `<body>` content (specifically the `{children}`) with `<ThemeRegistry>`.

The `EmotionCache.tsx` component has been created. Now, I will modify `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` to use the `ThemeRegistry` to provide the Material UI theme and CSS baseline to the application.

First, I need to read the current content of `layout.tsx`.

<read_file>
<path>apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx</path>
</read_file>

I have the content of `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.
Now I need to modify it:
1.  Add an import for `ThemeRegistry`: `import ThemeRegistry from '@/theme/ThemeRegistry';` (using the `@/` alias which is configured as `./src/*` in `tsconfig.json`).
2.  Wrap the `{children}` inside the `<body>` tag with `<ThemeRegistry>`.

The `Geist` font setup can remain. The `ThemeRegistry` will wrap the content within the body.
The `className` on the body for fonts should also be preserved.
</thinking>
I have the content of `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`. Now I will modify it to include the `ThemeRegistry`.

This involves importing the `ThemeRegistry` and wrapping the main content (`children`) within it.

The `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` file has been updated to use the `ThemeRegistry`.
This completes the configuration of the Material UI theme provider as per sub-task 2.2.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 2.2 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (2.3).

The line to change in the task list is:
`- [ ] 2.2 Configure Material UI theme provider in \`_app.tsx\`` (Note: the task description still says `_app.tsx`, but we've correctly used `layout.tsx`. The checkmark applies to the intent of the task.)
to
`- [x] 2.2 Configure Material UI theme provider in \`_app.tsx\``
</thinking>
The Material UI theme provider has been configured in `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` using the `ThemeRegistry` component. This completes sub-task 2.2.

I will now update the task list.

Task 2.2 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 2.3: "Create a shared UI components directory (e.g., `components/`)".
This directory should be for shared components within the `apps/main-app` application.
Given the Next.js app uses a `src` directory, a common place for this would be `apps/main-app/src/components/`.

I need to ask the user for permission to proceed with task 2.3.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 2.4 as complete.
2.  Since 2.4 is the last sub-task under parent task 2.0, I also need to mark parent task 2.0 as complete.
3.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next main task (3.0), specifically sub-task 3.1.

Lines to change in the task list:
`- [ ] 2.4 Add a sample shared component using Material UI`
to
`- [x] 2.4 Add a sample shared component using Material UI`

And:
`- [ ] 2.0 Integrate Material UI and set up shared UI components`
to
`- [x] 2.0 Integrate Material UI and set up shared UI components`

The `SampleButton.tsx` component has been created. This completes sub-task 2.4.

Task 2.0 and all its sub-tasks are now complete, and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead before starting the next sub-task.

The next main task is "3.0 Implement dynamic microfrontend registration and routing system".
The first sub-task under this is 3.1: "Design a standard interface/contract for microfrontends".

This task is about defining a TypeScript interface or type that each microfrontend will adhere to. This contract will likely include properties like the microfrontend's name, path, and the component to render. This definition will likely go into a new file, perhaps in `apps/main-app/src/types/` or `apps/main-app/src/interfaces/`. Let's plan for `apps/main-app/src/types/microfrontend.ts`.

I need to ask the user for permission to proceed with task 3.1.

The user has approved proceeding with task 3.1: "Design a standard interface/contract for microfrontends".

I will create a new file `apps/main-app/src/types/microfrontend.ts` and define a TypeScript interface named `Microfrontend` within it.
This interface should include:
- `name`: A string for the display name of the microfrontend (e.g., for navigation).
- `path`: A string for the URL path segment (e.g., "home", "profile").
- `component`: A React component type (`React.ComponentType` or `React.FC`). This component will be dynamically loaded.

The `component` type might need to be `React.LazyExoticComponent<React.ComponentType<any>>` if we plan to use `React.lazy` for dynamic imports, or a more generic `React.ComponentType<any>` if the loading mechanism is different. For now, `React.ComponentType` is a good starting point.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 3.1.

I will create a new file `apps/main-app/src/types/microfrontend.ts` and define a `Microfrontend` interface. This interface will serve as the contract for all microfrontends.

The `Microfrontend` interface has been defined in `apps/main-app/src/types/microfrontend.ts`.
This completes sub-task 3.1.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 3.1 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (3.2).

The line to change in the task list is:

Task 3.1 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 3.2: "Create a registry utility for registering microfrontends".
The PRD "Relevant Files" section mentions `apps/main-app/utils/microfrontendRegistry.ts` for this purpose.
This utility will likely:
-   Hold an array or map of registered `Microfrontend` objects.
-   Provide functions to register a new microfrontend.
-   Provide functions to get all registered microfrontends (e.g., for navigation).
-   Provide a function to get a specific microfrontend by its path or ID.

I will create this file and implement a basic structure for the registry.
I need to ask the user for permission to proceed with task 3.2.

The user has approved proceeding with task 3.2.
I will create `apps/main-app/src/utils/microfrontendRegistry.ts`.

This file will:
- Import the `Microfrontend` interface from `../types/microfrontend`.
- Define a private array or map to store registered microfrontends.
- Export functions:
    - `registerMicrofrontend(mfe: Microfrontend): void`
    - `getRegisteredMicrofrontends(): Microfrontend[]`
    - `getMicrofrontendByPath(path: string): Microfrontend | undefined`
    - `getMicrofrontendById(id: string): Microfrontend | undefined`

I'll start with an array-based implementation for simplicity.

Task 3.2 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 3.3: "Implement dynamic routing logic based on the registry".
This involves creating dynamic routes in the Next.js App Router that can render the appropriate microfrontend component based on the URL path.

In Next.js App Router, this is typically done using a dynamic route segment, like `[...slug]` or `[mfePath]`.
I'll need to create a page file, for example, `apps/main-app/src/app/[...mfePath]/page.tsx`.
This page component will:
1.  Extract the path from the URL.
2.  Use `getMicrofrontendByPath` from the registry to find the corresponding microfrontend configuration.
3.  If found, render its `component`.
4.  If not found, render a 404 page or a suitable fallback.
5.  The components from microfrontends will likely be client components, so this dynamic route page might also need to be a client component (`'use client';`).

I need to ask the user for permission to proceed with task 3.3.
</thinking>
Sub-task 3.2 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 3.3: "Implement dynamic routing logic based on the registry".
I plan to implement this by creating a dynamic route page in the Next.js App Router, for example, at `apps/main-app/src/app/[...mfePath]/page.tsx`. This page will use the microfrontend registry to look up and render the correct microfrontend component based on the URL.

May I proceed with this task?

The user has approved proceeding with task 3.3.
I will create the dynamic route page at `apps/main-app/src/app/[...mfePath]/page.tsx`.

This page component will:
- Be a client component (`'use client';`).
- Use `useParams` from `next/navigation` to get the path segments.
- Reconstruct the path (e.g., if `mfePath` is `['foo', 'bar']`, the path is `foo/bar`).
- Call `getMicrofrontendByPath` from the registry.
- Render the microfrontend's component if found.
- Render a "Not Found" message or component if not found. (Next.js has a `notFound()` function for this).
- It should also handle the case where `params.mfePath` might be undefined or empty, though a catch-all route `[...mfePath]` usually ensures it's an array.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 3.3.

I will create the dynamic route page at `apps/main-app/src/app/[...mfePath]/page.tsx`. This page will handle rendering the appropriate microfrontend based on the URL.

The dynamic route page `apps/main-app/src/app/[...mfePath]/page.tsx` has been created.
This completes sub-task 3.3.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 3.3 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (3.4).

The line to change in the task list is:
`- [ ] 3.3 Implement dynamic routing logic based on the registry`
to
`- [x] 3.3 Implement dynamic routing logic based on the registry`
</thinking>
The dynamic routing logic has been implemented in `apps/main-app/src/app/[...mfePath]/page.tsx`. This completes sub-task 3.3.

I will now update the task list.

Task 3.3 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 3.4: "Add unit tests for the registry and routing logic".
This involves two parts:
1.  Unit tests for `microfrontendRegistry.ts`.
2.  Unit tests for the dynamic routing page `[...mfePath]/page.tsx`.

The PRD "Relevant Files" section mentions `apps/main-app/utils/microfrontendRegistry.test.ts`.
The Next.js app was initialized with ESLint, but Jest (or another test runner) needs to be set up if it wasn't part of `create-next-app`'s default for app router, or if a specific configuration is needed. The `create-next-app` command I used (`--typescript --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --import-alias "@/*"`) does not explicitly include a test runner like Jest by default.

Before writing tests, I should:
1.  Check if Jest is already configured (e.g., a `jest.config.js` or similar in `apps/main-app`).
2.  If not, I'll need to install Jest and necessary related packages (`jest`, `@types/jest`, `ts-jest` for TypeScript, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`).
3.  Configure Jest for the Next.js project. Next.js has specific recommendations for this.

Let's first check for an existing Jest configuration.
Then, I'll ask the user for permission to proceed with setting up Jest (if needed) and writing the tests.
The PRD notes say: "Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests." This implies Jest is expected.
</thinking>
Sub-task 3.3 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 3.4: "Add unit tests for the registry and routing logic".
This involves testing `microfrontendRegistry.ts` and the dynamic routing page `[...mfePath]/page.tsx`.

Before writing the tests, I need to ensure a test runner like Jest is set up in the `apps/main-app` project. The `create-next-app` command we used doesn't always include Jest by default.

May I proceed to:
1. Check for an existing Jest setup in `apps/main-app`.
2. If Jest is not set up, install and configure it.
3. Then, write the unit tests for the registry and routing logic.

The user has approved checking/setting up Jest and writing unit tests.

Step 1: Check for existing Jest configuration in `apps/main-app`.
I'll look for `jest.config.js`, `jest.config.ts`, or Jest configuration within `apps/main-app/package.json`.
I can use `list_files` for `apps/main-app` and check the output.
</thinking>
Okay, I will start by checking if Jest is already configured in the `apps/main-app` project. I'll list the files at the root of `apps/main-app` to look for Jest configuration files.

The file listing for `apps/main-app` does not show any `jest.config.js` or `jest.config.ts`.
I also need to check `apps/main-app/package.json` for any Jest related scripts or devDependencies.
</thinking>
No Jest configuration file (like `jest.config.js` or `jest.config.ts`) is visible in the `apps/main-app` directory.

Next, I'll check the `apps/main-app/package.json` file for any Jest-related scripts or dependencies.

The `apps/main-app/package.json` file does not contain any Jest-related scripts (like a "test" script invoking Jest) or Jest devDependencies.

This confirms that Jest is not currently set up in the `apps/main-app` project.
Therefore, I need to install Jest and its related packages, then configure it.

Next.js documentation provides guidance on setting up Jest. This typically involves:
1.  Installing `jest`, `@types/jest`, `ts-jest` (or `babel-jest` if not using TS for tests, but we are), `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and `jest-environment-jsdom`.
2.  Creating a `jest.config.js` (or `.ts`) file.
3.  Creating a `jest.setup.js` (or `.ts`) file for global test setup, like importing `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
4.  Updating `tsconfig.json` if necessary (e.g., to include test file types if not already covered).
5.  Adding a test script to `package.json`.

I'll start by installing the necessary dev dependencies into the `apps/main-app` workspace.
The packages are: `jest@^29` (Next.js currently recommends Jest 29), `jest-environment-jsdom@^29`, `@types/jest@^29`, `@testing-library/react@^15` (latest stable), `@testing-library/jest-dom@^6` (latest stable). `ts-jest` is also needed for TypeScript.
Next.js also recommends `identity-obj-proxy` for mocking CSS modules if they are used (Tailwind is used, so this might be relevant).

Let's install these: `jest jest-environment-jsdom @types/jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom ts-jest identity-obj-proxy`.
I'll use specific versions compatible with Next.js recommendations if possible, but latest stable for testing-library should be fine.
Next.js docs often point to specific versions, so it's good to be mindful. For Jest, they explicitly mention v29.
`@testing-library/jest-dom` v6 is the current major.
`@testing-library/react` v15 is the current major.
`ts-jest` should align with Jest 29.

Command: `npm install --save-dev jest@^29.7.0 jest-environment-jsdom@^29.7.0 @types/jest@^29.5.12 @testing-library/react@^15.0.0 @testing-library/jest-dom@^6.0.0 ts-jest@^29.1.0 identity-obj-proxy -w apps/main-app`
(Using specific minor/patch versions based on common stable ones for Jest 29, and latest major for testing-library).
</thinking>
The `package.json` for `apps/main-app` confirms that Jest is not installed.

I will now proceed to install Jest and its necessary companion packages as development dependencies in the `apps/main-app` workspace. This includes `jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`, `@types/jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `ts-jest`, and `identity-obj-proxy` for CSS module mocking. I'll aim for versions compatible with Next.js and current testing best practices.

This command will add these packages as devDependencies to `apps/main-app/package.json`.

<thinking>
The `npm install` command failed with an `ERESOLVE` error.
The key part of the error is:
`Could not resolve dependency: peer react@"^18.0.0" from @testing-library/react@15.0.7`
while the project has `react@19.1.0` (actually, the `package.json` I saw earlier had `react@^19.0.0`).

This means `@testing-library/react@15.0.7` (which is the resolved version of `^15.0.0`) has a peer dependency on React 18, but our project `main-app` is using React 19.

There are a few ways to handle this:
1.  **Downgrade React to v18 in `main-app`**: This is a significant change and might not be desirable if React 19 features are planned or already used.
2.  **Find a version of `@testing-library/react` compatible with React 19**: `@testing-library/react` v16 is in alpha and supports React 19. Using an alpha version might be risky for stability.
3.  **Use `--legacy-peer-deps` or `--force`**: This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if the incompatibility is severe. It's generally a last resort.

Given that React 19 is relatively new, testing library compatibility might still be catching up.
The Next.js `create-next-app` installed React 19.

Let's check if `@testing-library/react` has a stable release that officially supports React 19.
A quick search suggests that `@testing-library/react` v15 *should* work with React 19 by now, or a very recent patch might have added support. The error indicates `15.0.7` is being pulled.

Perhaps the issue is that Jest 29 itself has stronger ties to React 18 through its ecosystem or transitive dependencies of other testing libraries.

Let's try a different approach for `@testing-library/react`.
The React team released `@testing-library/react-native` specific versions for React 19.
For `@testing-library/react` itself, version 15.0.0 was released *before* React 19 stable.
However, the community often uses it with newer React versions.

The error is specifically about the *peer dependency* declaration.
It's possible that `@testing-library/react@15.0.7` works fine with React 19, but its `package.json` hasn't been updated to list `react@^19.0.0` as a compatible peer.

Given the options, and to avoid downgrading React or using alpha software immediately:
- Option A: Try installing with `--legacy-peer-deps`. This is often acceptable if the actual incompatibility is minor or just a version mismatch in `peerDependencies`.
- Option B: Check if a newer *patch* of `@testing-library/react@15.x.x` explicitly supports React 19 in its peer deps. (e.g. `15.1.0` or similar, if available). A quick check on npm shows `15.0.7` is indeed the latest v15.

Let's try with `--legacy-peer-deps` first, as it's a common workaround for this type of peer dependency mismatch where the library might still be compatible. I will make sure to inform the user about this flag and its implications.

If this doesn't work or leads to issues later, we might need to explore `@testing-library/react` v16 alpha or see if Jest 29 + React 19 has other known recipes.
The Next.js documentation for Jest setup might also have notes on React 19 compatibility. (A quick check of Next.js docs shows they still primarily reference React 18 in their Jest examples, but this might be slightly outdated).
</thinking>
The installation failed due to a peer dependency conflict: `@testing-library/react@15.0.7` expects `react@^18.0.0`, but your project `main-app` has `react@^19.0.0`.

This is a common issue when new major versions of React are released, as testing libraries take time to update their declared peer dependencies. Often, the library is still compatible, but the version constraint in its `package.json` hasn't been updated.

I can try to proceed with the installation using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. This flag tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts and proceed with the installation. While this can sometimes lead to issues if there are true incompatibilities, it's often a necessary workaround in such cases.

Shall I try installing the Jest dependencies again with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag?

The user has decided to skip sub-task 3.4 (Add unit tests for the registry and routing logic) entirely, including not installing test libraries.

This means:
1.  Sub-task 3.4 will be skipped. I should not mark it as complete.
2.  Since 3.4 is skipped, the parent task 3.0 ("Implement dynamic microfrontend registration and routing system") cannot be marked as complete yet, as one of its sub-tasks is now intentionally not done.
3.  I need to ask the user what to do next. Should I proceed to task 4.0, or do they want to address task 3.0 differently?

Given the `process-task-list.md` guidelines, I should update the task list to reflect the skipped state if possible (though the markdown checklist doesn't have a "skipped" state, so I'll leave it unchecked) and then ask for permission for the next task.

The next task in sequence would be 4.0, starting with 4.1.
I will ask if we should proceed to 4.1.
</thinking>
Understood. We will skip sub-task 3.4 (Add unit tests for the registry and routing logic) and will not install any test libraries at this time.

Task 3.0 ("Implement dynamic microfrontend registration and routing system") will remain partially complete as sub-task 3.4 is being skipped.

The next task in the list is "4.0 Create navigation component listing all registered microfrontends", starting with sub-task 4.1: "Design and implement a navigation bar using Material UI".

May I proceed with sub-task 4.1?

The user has approved proceeding with sub-task 4.1: "Design and implement a navigation bar using Material UI".

The PRD "Relevant Files" section mentions `apps/main-app/components/Navigation.tsx`.
This component should:
1.  Be created in `apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx` (consistent with `SampleButton.tsx` and `src` structure).
2.  Use Material UI components like `AppBar`, `Toolbar`, `Button`, or `Tabs` to create a navigation bar.
3.  For now, it will be a static design. Task 4.2 will make it dynamic.
4.  It should be a client component (`'use client';`) as it will likely involve user interaction (clicks) and potentially state for responsive menus later.

I will create `Navigation.tsx` with a basic MUI `AppBar` and `Toolbar`.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 4.1: "Design and implement a navigation bar using Material UI".

I will create a new component `Navigation.tsx` in `apps/main-app/src/components/`. This component will render a basic navigation bar using Material UI's `AppBar` and `Toolbar`.

The `Navigation.tsx` component has been created with a basic Material UI AppBar.
This component needs to be added to the main layout (`apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`) so it's visible on all pages.

Steps:
1.  Read `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.
2.  Import the `Navigation` component.
3.  Add the `<Navigation />` component within the `ThemeRegistry`, likely before `{children}`, so it appears at the top of the page.

1.  Import the `Navigation` component: `import Navigation from '@/components/Navigation';` (using the `@/` alias).
2.  Add `<Navigation />` inside `<ThemeRegistry>`, before `{children}`.
    This will make the layout:

The `Navigation` component has been added to the main layout.
This completes the implementation part of sub-task 4.1.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 4.1 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (4.2).

The line to change in the task list is:
`- [ ] 4.1 Design and implement a navigation bar using Material UI`
to
`- [x] 4.1 Design and implement a navigation bar using Material UI`
</thinking>
The `Navigation` component has been added to `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`. This completes sub-task 4.1.

I will now update the task list.

Task 4.1 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 4.2: "Dynamically list all registered microfrontends in the navigation".
This involves modifying `Navigation.tsx` to:
1.  Import `getRegisteredMicrofrontends` from `@/utils/microfrontendRegistry`.
2.  Call this function to get the list of microfrontends.
3.  Map over the list to render navigation links (e.g., MUI `Button` components with `href` pointing to the microfrontend's path).
4.  This will likely require `useEffect` and `useState` to fetch and store the microfrontends if they are registered asynchronously or if the component needs to react to changes, but for an initial client-side registry, a direct call might suffice. Since the registry is currently a simple in-memory array, it can be called directly during render.

I need to ask the user for permission to proceed with task 4.2.
</thinking>
Sub-task 4.1 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 4.2: "Dynamically list all registered microfrontends in the navigation".
I plan to modify the `Navigation.tsx` component to fetch the list of registered microfrontends from the `microfrontendRegistry` and render navigation links for each one.

May I proceed with this task?

The user has approved proceeding with task 4.2.
I need to modify `apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx`.

Changes:
1.  Import `getRegisteredMicrofrontends` from `@/utils/microfrontendRegistry`.
2.  Import `Microfrontend` type from `@/types/microfrontend`.
3.  Use `useState` and `useEffect` to fetch the microfrontends when the component mounts. This is good practice even if the current registry is synchronous, as it allows for future asynchronous registration.
4.  Remove the static example links.
5.  Map over the fetched microfrontends to render MUI `Button` components. Each button should link to the microfrontend's path (e.g., `/${mfe.path}`) and display its name.
6.  It's good to use Next.js `Link` component for client-side navigation, wrapping the MUI `Button`. So, import `Link` from `next/link`.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 4.2.

I will modify `apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx` to dynamically fetch and display links to all registered microfrontends.

Task 4.2 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 4.3: "Add navigation unit tests".
The PRD "Relevant Files" section mentions `apps/main-app/components/Navigation.test.tsx`.
However, in task 3.4, the user decided to "ignore this step, dont create unit tests or install test librarires".

This means sub-task 4.3 should also be skipped.
If 4.3 is skipped, then parent task 4.0 ("Create navigation component listing all registered microfrontends") will remain partially complete.

I need to confirm with the user if they also want to skip 4.3, consistent with their decision for 3.4.

Sub-task 4.2 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 4.3: "Add navigation unit tests".

The user has confirmed to skip sub-task 4.3 (navigation unit tests).

This means:
1.  Sub-task 4.3 will be skipped. I should not mark it as complete.
2.  Since 4.3 is skipped, the parent task 4.0 ("Create navigation component listing all registered microfrontends") will remain partially complete.
3.  I need to ask the user for permission to proceed to the next task.

The next task in sequence would be 5.0, starting with 5.1.
I will ask if we should proceed to 5.1.
</thinking>
Understood. We will skip sub-task 4.3 (Add navigation unit tests).

Task 4.0 ("Create navigation component listing all registered microfrontends") will remain partially complete as sub-task 4.3 is being skipped.

The next task in the list is "5.0 Add example 'home page' microfrontend and developer documentation", starting with sub-task 5.1: "Scaffold a simple 'home page' microfrontend in `microfrontends/home/`".

May I proceed with sub-task 5.1?

The user has approved proceeding with sub-task 5.1: "Scaffold a simple 'home page' microfrontend in `microfrontends/home/`".

This involves creating a new directory `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/` and placing a simple React component within it. This component will serve as the "home page" microfrontend.

The structure for this microfrontend could be very simple:
- `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/index.tsx` (or `HomePage.tsx`) - The main component file.
- Optionally, a `package.json` if this microfrontend were to be a separate package in the monorepo. However, the task description implies it's part of `main-app`'s structure for now. The PRD "Relevant Files" lists `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/` as an "Example 'home page' microfrontend implementation", not necessarily a separate package. For simplicity, I'll start by creating just the component file. If it needs to be a separate package later (e.g., for independent building/versioning), that can be a refinement.

Let's create `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/HomePage.tsx`.
This component should be simple, perhaps displaying a welcome message. It should also be a client component.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 5.1.

I will scaffold a simple "home page" microfrontend by creating a `HomePage.tsx` component in the `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/` directory.

<write_to_file>

The `HomePage.tsx` microfrontend component has been created.
This completes sub-task 5.1.

Next steps:
1.  Update the task list file `tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md` to mark task 5.1 as complete.
2.  Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next sub-task (5.2).

The line to change in the task list is:

Task 5.1 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 5.2: "Register the home page microfrontend in the registry".
This involves:
1.  Importing the `HomePage` component (likely using `React.lazy` for dynamic import) and the `registerMicrofrontend` function.
2.  Calling `registerMicrofrontend` with the details of the `HomePage` microfrontend.
    - `id`: e.g., "home"
    - `path`: e.g., "home" (or "" for the root, but "home" is more explicit for a named MFE)
    - `name`: e.g., "Home"
    - `component`: The (lazily loaded) `HomePage` component.

This registration logic should ideally run when the application starts. A good place for this in a Next.js App Router application could be:
- In the root `layout.tsx` (though this makes it a client component if not already, or requires a new client component wrapper).
- In a dedicated initialization file that is imported early.
- For simplicity and to ensure it's registered before navigation or routing attempts to use it, we can create a small client component that performs registration and is included in `layout.tsx`. Or, more simply for now, perform the registration directly in a file that's guaranteed to run, like `apps/main-app/src/app/page.tsx` (if we want it registered when the host app's root page loads) or create a dedicated registration module.

Let's consider creating a file like `apps/main-app/src/microfrontends.ts` (or `apps/main-app/src/registerMfes.ts`) which imports and registers all known local microfrontends. This file can then be imported in `layout.tsx` or another central place to ensure registration happens.

For now, I'll create `apps/main-app/src/app/registerMicrofrontends.ts` (or similar name, maybe `apps/main-app/src/lib/registerMicrofrontends.ts` to follow common Next.js patterns for non-page/component files). Let's use `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`. This file will handle the registration.
Then, this loader file needs to be imported in `layout.tsx` to execute the registration.

The `HomePage` component is at `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/HomePage.tsx`.
The alias `@/` points to `apps/main-app/src/`. So, the path from `src` would be `../microfrontends/home/HomePage`.
However, `React.lazy` needs a path relative to the current file or an alias.
If `microfrontendLoader.ts` is in `src/lib/`, then the path to `HomePage.tsx` would be `../../microfrontends/home/HomePage`.

Let's define the registration in `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`.
</thinking>
Sub-task 5.1 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 5.2: "Register the home page microfrontend in the registry".
I plan to:
1. Create a new file, for example, `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`.
2. In this file, I'll use `React.lazy` to dynamically import the `HomePage` component from `../../microfrontends/home/HomePage`.
3. Then, I'll call `registerMicrofrontend` from our registry utility to register the "Home" microfrontend with an appropriate path (e.g., "home") and the lazily loaded component.
4. Finally, this `microfrontendLoader.ts` file will need to be imported in a central place like `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` to ensure the registration code runs when the app initializes.

May I proceed with this approach?

The user has approved the approach for task 5.2.

Step 1: Create `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`.
This file will:
- Import `React.lazy`.
- Import `registerMicrofrontend` from `@/utils/microfrontendRegistry`.
- Lazily import `HomePage` from `../../microfrontends/home/HomePage`. (Path relative to `src/lib/` to `microfrontends/home/`)
- Call `registerMicrofrontend` for the home page.
- The path for the home microfrontend could be "home" or an empty string "" if it's meant to be the default/root microfrontend. Let's use "home" for now, as the host app's root page (`/`) is separate.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 5.2.

First, I will create the `microfrontendLoader.ts` file at `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`. This file will handle the registration of the "Home" microfrontend.

<write_to_file>
<path>apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts</path>
<content>
import React from 'react';
import { registerMicrofrontend } from '@/utils/microfrontendRegistry';

// Lazily load the HomePage microfrontend component

// Note: The path for React.lazy needs to be resolvable.
// If `@/../microfrontends/home/HomePage` doesn't work due to alias limitations with `../`,
// a direct relative path from `src/lib` like `../../microfrontends/home/HomePage` might be needed.
// Let's try with the alias first, assuming it resolves correctly from the `baseUrl` in tsconfig.

// Register the Home microfrontend
registerMicrofrontend({
  id: 'home',
  path: 'home', // URL path will be /home
  name: 'Home MFE', // Display name for navigation
  component: HomePageMFE,
  meta: {

// To ensure this module executes and registers the MFE,

The `microfrontendLoader.ts` file has been created.
The import path `import('@/../microfrontends/home/HomePage')` might be problematic. The `@/` alias typically points to `src/`. So `@/../` would attempt to go up from `src/` and then into `microfrontends/`. This is not standard and might not work as expected with module resolution or bundlers.

A more robust path for `React.lazy` from `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts` to `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/HomePage.tsx` would be a direct relative path: `../../microfrontends/home/HomePage`.

I should correct this path in `microfrontendLoader.ts`.

After that, Step 2 is to import this loader into `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` to ensure the registration code runs. This import should be for side effects only (to execute the registration).
</thinking>
The `microfrontendLoader.ts` file has been created. I noticed a potential issue with the import path used for `React.lazy`. The path `@/../microfrontends/home/HomePage` might not resolve correctly. I'll change it to a direct relative path `../../microfrontends/home/HomePage` for better reliability.

The import path in `microfrontendLoader.ts` has been corrected.

Now, Step 2 is to import this `microfrontendLoader.ts` into `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx` to ensure the registration code runs when the application initializes. This import is for side effects only.

I need to:
1. Read the content of `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.
2. Add an import statement like `import '@/lib/microfrontendLoader';` at the top.
</thinking>
The import path in `microfrontendLoader.ts` has been corrected.

Now, I will import this `microfrontendLoader.ts` file into `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`. This is done to ensure that the code within `microfrontendLoader.ts` (which registers the microfrontend) executes when the application starts.

First, I'll read the current content of `layout.tsx`.

I have the content of `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`.
I need to add the import for `microfrontendLoader.ts` for its side effects.
A good place for this import is after other library/component imports but before the component definition itself.
The import will be `import '@/lib/microfrontendLoader';`.
</thinking>
I have the content of `apps/main-app/src/app/layout.tsx`. Now I will add an import statement for ` '@/lib/microfrontendLoader';` to ensure the microfrontend registration logic is executed.

Task 5.2 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 5.3: "Add documentation (README) for adding/registering new microfrontends".
The PRD "Relevant Files" section mentions `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md`.
This README should explain:
1.  The `Microfrontend` interface (`apps/main-app/src/types/microfrontend.ts`).
2.  How to create a new microfrontend component (e.g., in a subdirectory under `apps/main-app/microfrontends/`).
3.  How to register it using `React.lazy` and `registerMicrofrontend` in `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`.
4.  Mention the `HomePage.tsx` as an example.

I need to ask the user for permission to proceed with task 5.3.
</thinking>
Sub-task 5.2 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 5.3: "Add documentation (README) for adding/registering new microfrontends".

The user has approved proceeding with task 5.3.
I will create `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md`.

The content should cover:
- Purpose of this directory.
- Steps to add a new microfrontend:
    - Create a component (e.g., `MyNewMFE.tsx` in a new subdirectory like `apps/main-app/microfrontends/my-new-mfe/`).
    - Define its properties according to the `Microfrontend` interface (path: `src/types/microfrontend.ts`).
    - Register it in `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts` using `React.lazy` and `registerMicrofrontend`.
- Point to `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/HomePage.tsx` and its registration in `microfrontendLoader.ts` as a concrete example.
</thinking>
Okay, proceeding with sub-task 5.3.

I will create the `README.md` file at `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md` with instructions on how to add and register new microfrontends.

# Adding and Registering Microfrontends

This directory (`apps/main-app/microfrontends/`) is intended to house the implementations of individual microfrontend applications or modules that are part of the `main-app`.

## How to Add a New Microfrontend

Follow these steps to create and integrate a new microfrontend:

### 1. Create Your Microfrontend Component

1.  **Create a new directory** for your microfrontend under `apps/main-app/microfrontends/`. For example, if your microfrontend is named "UserProfile", create `apps/main-app/microfrontends/user-profile/`.
2.  **Implement your React component** within this new directory. This will be the main entry point for your microfrontend. For example, `apps/main-app/microfrontends/user-profile/UserProfilePage.tsx`.
    ```tsx
    // Example: apps/main-app/microfrontends/user-profile/UserProfilePage.tsx
    'use client';

    import React from 'react';
    import Typography from '@mui/material/Typography';

    const UserProfilePage: React.FC = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <Typography variant="h4">User Profile Microfrontend</Typography>
          {/* ... your component's content ... */}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default UserProfilePage;
    ```

### 2. Understand the Microfrontend Contract

Your microfrontend will be registered using an object that conforms to the `Microfrontend` interface defined in `apps/main-app/src/types/microfrontend.ts`. Ensure you understand the properties required:

-   `id` (string): A unique identifier (e.g., "user-profile").
-   `path` (string): The URL path segment (e.g., "profile", which will result in `/profile`).
-   `name` (string): A display name for navigation (e.g., "User Profile").
-   `component` (React.LazyExoticComponent): Your lazily-loaded React component.
-   `meta` (optional object): Any additional metadata.

### 3. Register Your Microfrontend

Registration is handled in `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`.

1.  **Open `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`**.
2.  **Import your component using `React.lazy`**:
    ```typescript
    // At the top of microfrontendLoader.ts, with other lazy imports
    const UserProfileMFE = React.lazy(() => import('../../microfrontends/user-profile/UserProfilePage'));
    ```
    *Ensure the import path is correct relative to `apps/main-app/src/lib/`.*
3.  **Call `registerMicrofrontend`**:
    ```typescript
    // Within microfrontendLoader.ts, with other registrations
    registerMicrofrontend({
      id: 'user-profile',
      path: 'profile', // This will be accessible at /profile
      name: 'User Profile',
      component: UserProfileMFE,
      meta: {
        // optional metadata
      },
    });
    ```

### 4. Test Your Integration

Once registered, your microfrontend should:
-   Appear in the main navigation bar (if the navigation component is set up to list all registered MFEs).
-   Be routable via its specified path (e.g., navigating to `/profile` should render your `UserProfilePage`).

## Example: Home Page Microfrontend

A "Home Page" microfrontend has already been implemented as an example:
-   **Component**: `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/HomePage.tsx`
-   **Registration**: See its entry in `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`.

Refer to this example for a practical demonstration of the steps above.

## Relevant Files

- `apps/main-app/` - Main Next.js application serving as the host for microfrontends.
- `apps/main-app/pages/_app.tsx` - Custom App component for global providers and Material UI setup.
- `apps/main-app/components/Navigation.tsx` - Navigation component listing and linking all registered microfrontends.

Task 5.3 is complete and the task list is updated.
According to the `process-task-list.md` instructions, I need to stop and wait for user go-ahead.

The next sub-task is 5.4: "Reference the home page microfrontend in the documentation as an example".
This task was already addressed when creating the `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md` in sub-task 5.3. The README explicitly includes:
```markdown
## Example: Home Page Microfrontend

A "Home Page" microfrontend has already been implemented as an example:
-   **Component**: `apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/HomePage.tsx`
-   **Registration**: See its entry in `apps/main-app/src/lib/microfrontendLoader.ts`.

Refer to this example for a practical demonstration of the steps above.
```
So, sub-task 5.4 is effectively complete.

I will:
1. Mark 5.4 as complete.
2. Since 5.4 is the last sub-task of 5.0, and tasks 3.4 and 4.3 were skipped, I need to consider the state of parent tasks 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0.
   - Task 3.0 is incomplete because 3.4 was skipped.
   - Task 4.0 is incomplete because 4.3 was skipped.
   - Task 5.0 will be complete once 5.4 is marked.
3. After updating the task list for 5.4 and 5.0, I should inform the user that all *planned active* tasks from the PRD are done, noting the skipped test tasks. Then I can use `attempt_completion`.

Lines to change in the task list:
`- [ ] 5.4 Reference the home page microfrontend in the documentation as an example`
to
`- [x] 5.4 Reference the home page microfrontend in the documentation as an example`

And:
`- [ ] 5.0 Add example "home page" microfrontend and developer documentation`
to
`- [x] 5.0 Add example "home page" microfrontend and developer documentation`
</thinking>
Sub-task 5.3 is complete and the task list is updated.

The next sub-task is 5.4: "Reference the home page microfrontend in the documentation as an example".
This was already done as part of creating the `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md` in the previous step. The README explicitly references the `HomePage.tsx` and its registration as an example.

Therefore, sub-task 5.4 is also complete. I will update the task list accordingly. This will also complete the parent task "5.0 Add example 'home page' microfrontend and developer documentation".

All sub-tasks for 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 are complete and marked.
Tasks 3.0 and 4.0 are partially complete because sub-tasks 3.4 and 4.3 (unit tests) were skipped by user request.

All *active* tasks assigned from the PRD have been addressed.
It's time to use `attempt_completion`.

The result should summarize what has been built:
- A Next.js host application (`apps/main-app`) within an NPM workspace monorepo structure.
- TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS configured for the host app.
- Material UI integration with a theme provider and a sample shared button.
- A system for dynamic microfrontend registration and routing:
    - `Microfrontend` interface.
    - Registry utility (`microfrontendRegistry.ts`).
    - Dynamic route page (`[...mfePath]/page.tsx`).
- A navigation component that dynamically lists registered microfrontends.
- An example "Home Page" microfrontend, registered and documented.
- Documentation for developers on how to add new microfrontends.
- Unit tests were skipped as per user instruction.

To showcase the result, I can suggest running the Next.js development server for `apps/main-app`.
The command would be `npm run dev -w apps/main-app`.
The user can then open `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/home` to see the host app and the example microfrontend.
</thinking>
All planned tasks from the 'tasks/tasks-prd-microfrontend-foundation.md' file have been addressed.
Tasks 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 are fully complete. Tasks 3.0 and 4.0 are partially complete as their respective unit testing sub-tasks (3.4 and 4.3) were skipped per your instruction.

Here's a summary of what has been set up:
- A Next.js application (`apps/main-app`) initialized with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS, serving as the host for microfrontends.
- An NPM workspace monorepo structure with `apps/main-app` as a workspace.
- Material UI integrated into `apps/main-app`, including a theme provider and a sample shared button component (`SampleButton.tsx`).
- A dynamic microfrontend registration and routing system, featuring:
    - A `Microfrontend` interface (`apps/main-app/src/types/microfrontend.ts`).
    - A registry utility (`apps/main-app/src/utils/microfrontendRegistry.ts`).
    - A dynamic route handler (`apps/main-app/src/app/[...mfePath]/page.tsx`) to render microfrontends.
- A navigation bar (`apps/main-app/src/components/Navigation.tsx`) that dynamically lists registered microfrontends.
- An example "Home Page" microfrontend (`apps/main-app/microfrontends/home/HomePage.tsx`) which is registered and will appear in the navigation.
- Documentation within `apps/main-app/microfrontends/README.md` explaining how to add new microfrontends.
- A root `README.md` providing an overview of the project structure.

You can now run the main application to see the structure in action.

The `attempt_completion` tool failed with an internal error "Current ask promise was ignored". This seems like an issue with the tooling environment itself, not with the work I've done or the parameters I provided to `attempt_completion`.

Since the error is internal to the tool, I should probably try the `attempt_completion` again with the exact same parameters. There's no action I can take to fix this type of error from my side.
</thinking>
It appears there was an internal error when I tried to complete the task. I will attempt to present the completion again with the same information.

The user denied the `attempt_completion` operation. This usually means they are not satisfied with the result or want further changes/clarifications.

Since the user denied it without specific feedback in this message, I should ask them what they would like me to do next or what changes they'd like to see.
</thinking>
Okay, it seems you're not ready to mark this as complete yet.

Could you please let me know what you'd like me to do next, or if there are any changes or additions you'd like to make to the current setup?
